Your task is to create a single, cohesive visual prompt in English, formatted as comma-separated keywords. Act as a film director setting up a specific shot.\n\n**Instruction:** Your task is to create a visual prompt based **only on stage which in the last message** in the chat, provided below.\n\nFollow these steps to construct a highly detailed and effective prompt. The goal is to combine all elements into a single, rich paragraph of keywords and descriptions that the AI can easily parse.\n1. Scene Foundation: Subject, Action & Shot\nStart with the core of your image. Combine the character(s), their primary action, and the cinematic shot type into one strong opening phrase.\nFormula: [Shot Type] of [Character(s)] who is/are [Action].\nExamples:\nExtreme close-up on a stoic warrior's face, a single tear tracing a path through the dirt on his cheek.\nDynamic medium shot of two rival mages, lunging at each other with crackling energy in their palms.\nBreathtaking wide-angle shot of a lone explorer standing on a cliff edge, gazing out at a vast, alien jungle below.\n2. Character Details: Expression & Physicality\nDescribe the crucial physical and emotional details for each character. Use descriptive adjectives. Instead of saying a character is \"sad,\" describe how they look sad. Focus on the 2-3 most important details per character.\nFormula: [Character's Name/Title], [physical detail 1], [expression detail 2], [posture/state detail 3].\nExamples:\nThe queen's expression is one of cold fury, her knuckles white as she grips the throne, posture ramrod straight.\nThe young thief has a nervous, darting gaze, hair matted with sweat, a fresh cut on his lip.\nThe old scholar's eyes are filled with gentle wisdom, a thoughtful smile on his face, hands stained with ink.\nImportant addendum: Overriding old details and emphasizing changes.\nIf a character's feature has changed during the story (e.g., a wound has healed, teeth have been fixed), you must explicitly and affirmatively describe the new state. To override the AI's \"memory\" of the old feature, use clear, specific adjectives for the new one. Using parentheses () can help emphasize the new detail.\n3. Apparel & Gear: Material & Condition\nDescribe the clothing, armor, and any key items the characters are wearing or holding. Focus on material, style, and condition to add texture and story.\nFormula: wearing a [Condition] [Material] [Clothing Type].\nExamples:\nwearing a travel-worn leather tunic and a heavy, mud-splattered wool cloak.\nadorned in an elegant, pristine dark-blue silk gown with intricate silver embroidery.\nequipped in gleaming, battle-scarred plate armor with a glowing sigil on the chestplate.\n4. Environment & Depth: Setting, Foreground, Background\nGround your scene in a specific location. Add 1-2 key objects in the foreground or background to create depth and context.\nFormula: in a [Location], [Background Detail], [Foreground Detail].\nExamples:\nin a cozy, cluttered wizard's study, with towering bookshelves in the background and a magical, glowing orb on the table in the foreground.\ninside a cavernous, dripping cave, with giant phosphorescent mushrooms glowing faintly in the background.\non the deck of a storm-tossed ship, with crashing waves and a dark, ominous sky, ropes and barrels scattered across the foreground.\n5. Lighting & Atmosphere: Mood & Tone\nThis is critical for emotion. Define the lighting source, quality, and overall mood. Be specific.\nFormula: [Mood] atmosphere, [Lighting Type], [Light Source].\nExamples:\nMelancholy and somber atmosphere, with soft, cold moonlight streaming through a single window, casting long, dramatic shadows.\nTense and suspenseful atmosphere, lit only by the flickering, warm light of a single torch, creating high contrast.\nSerene and magical atmosphere, bathed in the ethereal, soft glow of a fantasy sunset (golden hour), with volumetric light rays piercing through the trees.\n6. Art Style & Quality Keywords (Painterly & Illustrative Focus)\nThis is the most important step to define the final look. Instead of keywords that lead to a 3D-render look, we will use terms that emphasize a hand-drawn, artistic, and expressive style. Do not use words like hyperrealistic or Unreal Engine.\nChoose a \"style package\" from the options below, or mix and match keywords.\nOption A: Clean & Vibrant (Modern \"Anime-esque\" Look)\nThis style is characterized by clean lines, vibrant colors, and a polished, professional finish, similar to high-end game concept art or modern animated films.\nCore Keywords: Painterly illustration, 2D art, vibrant colors, clean lineart, cel-shading\nArtist Influences (use 1-2): by Artgerm, by WLOP, by Ilya Kuvshinov, Genshin Impact style\nQuality Enhancers: masterpiece, best quality, artstation, concept art, intricate details, dynamic lighting\nExample String: Painterly illustration, concept art, by Artgerm and WLOP, Genshin Impact style, vibrant colors, cel-shading, masterpiece, artstation, best quality, intricate details.\nOption B: Atmospheric & Textured (Classic Painterly Look)\nThis style focuses on visible brushstrokes, rich textures, and atmospheric lighting. It feels more organic and traditional, reminiscent of Studio Ghibli films or classic fantasy book illustrations.\nCore Keywords: Painterly, impressionistic, textured brushstrokes, atmospheric lighting, soft colors\nArtist Influences (use 1-2): Studio Ghibli style, by Guweiz, by Makoto Shinkai (for backgrounds), by Yoshitaka Amano\nQuality Enhancers: masterpiece, artstation, concept art, beautifully detailed, emotive, enchanting, soft focus\nExample String: Painterly concept art, Studio Ghibli style, by Guweiz, textured brushstrokes, atmospheric lighting, masterpiece, artstation, beautifully detailed, emotive.\nOption C: Graphic & Edgy (Comic/Graphic Novel Look)\nThis style uses bold lines, high contrast, and often a more dramatic or gritty color palette. It's perfect for scenes with action, tension, or a darker mood.\nCore Keywords: Graphic novel art, comic book style, bold outlines, high contrast, ink drawing, halftone (optional)\nArtist Influences (use 1-2): by Mike Mignola, by Ashley Wood, Arcane (TV series) style\nQuality Enhancers: masterpiece, gritty, dynamic composition, dramatic shadows, sharp focus, detailed illustration\nExample String: Graphic novel art, Arcane style, by Mike Mignola, bold outlines, high contrast, ink drawing, masterpiece, gritty, dramatic shadows, sharp focus.\nBy choosing one of these paths and using the specific keywords provided, you will give the AI much stronger instructions to create a truly artistic and \"hand-drawn\" image, avoiding the generic 3D render look.\n\n**Crucial Safety & Quality Filter (Apply these rules to your description):**\n*   **Language:** Use neutral, factual language ('direct gaze', not 'seductive').\n*   **Body Condition:** Always provide a clear, non-sexual context for physical states ('face wet from rain', not just 'wet').\n*   **Clothing:** Describe by type, not fit ('form-fitting dress', not 'tight dress').

Style & Quality Keywords (Ultra-Photorealistic Focus)\nTo generate an image that is indistinguishable from a real photograph, you must use keywords related to photography, cameras, lenses, and film. Crucially, avoid all artistic terms like art, painting, illustration, concept art, or artstation.\nChoose one of the style packages below for the best results.\nOption A: Modern Digital Photography (Crisp & Clean Look)\nThis style mimics a high-end, modern DSLR or mirrorless camera, resulting in a very sharp, clean, and high-resolution image.\nCore Keywords: Ultrarealistic photograph, professional photo, award-winning photography, high resolution\nCamera/Lens (use 1-2): shot on Sony a7 IV, 85mm lens, f/1.8, shallow depth of field, sharp focus, professional color grading\nDetail Enhancers: hyperdetailed, intricate details, detailed skin texture, pores\nExample String: Ultrarealistic photograph, shot on Sony a7 IV with an 85mm f/1.8 lens, professional color grading, sharp focus, hyperdetailed skin texture, shallow depth of field, award-winning photography.\nOption B: Vintage Film Photography (Analog & Nostalgic Look)\nThis style recreates the nostalgic, textured, and slightly imperfect look of an image shot on classic 35mm or medium format film.\nCore Keywords: Vintage film photograph, 35mm film photo, candid photo, nostalgic\nFilm Stock/Effects (use 1-2): Kodak Portra 400, Fujifilm Superia, film grain, light leaks, soft focus, warm tones\nDetail Enhancers: authentic, atmospheric, detailed fabric texture\nExample String: Vintage film photograph, shot on 35mm film, Kodak Portra 400, noticeable film grain, natural light, nostalgic atmosphere, authentic, candid photo.\nOption C: Cinematic Movie Still (Dramatic & Moody Look)\nThis style aims for the look of a high-budget film frame.
