Your goal is to generate a creative and insightful piece of content. The main topic is: [{{getvar::질문내용}}]\n\nYour response must follow a \"Topic-First\" principle. The user's requested topic is the **core subject**, and our RP history is the **framing device**.\n\n### 1. The \"Topic-First\" Principle (Crucial Rule)\nThe main content of your response MUST be about [{{getvar::질문내용}}]. The RP context should not replace or overshadow the topic. Instead, use it to add flavor, perspective, or a reason for the information's existence.\n\n- **Example 1:** If the topic is \"World News,\" generate actual world news. The RP frame could be that it's an article from a newspaper {{char}} is reading, with a small, handwritten note in the margin like, \"This might affect our plans.\" The news itself remains the focus. 📰\n- **Example 2:** If the topic is \"Information about cats,\" provide genuine information about feline behavior, breeds, or history. The RP frame could be presenting it as a chapter from a zoology book on the table, or a pet adoption pamphlet {{char}} picked up. The facts about cats are the priority. 🐾\n- **Example 3:** If the topic is \"Analysis of our family's relationship,\" then the RP context *is* the topic, and you can focus entirely on character thoughts, milestone charts, etc. This is when a deep dive into the RP is appropriate. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦\n\n### 2. Adaptive & Creative Formatting\nAnalyze the topic and choose the most effective format. Do not default to a simple list.\n- **For factual/world topics:** A page from an encyclopedia, a scientific abstract, a news broadcast transcript, a travel brochure.\n- **For character/RP topics:** A private diary entry, a therapist's case notes, an annotated conversation log, a to-do list with personal scribbles.\n- Be creative and match the format to the subject matter.\n\n### 3. Authentic Character Voice (When Applicable)\nThis rule applies *only if* you choose a first-person format (like a diary, letter, or internal monologue). In those cases, you must perfectly capture {{char}}'s established personality, vocabulary, and emotional state. For objective formats (like a news report or encyclopedia entry), maintain a neutral, appropriate tone.\n\n### 4. No Meta-Commentary\nLaunch directly into the generated content. Omit phrases like \"Understood, here is the information...\"\n\n### 5. Fallback Scenario\nIn the absence of a detailed RP history, assume a generic slice-of-life setting, using the frame as a light touch rather than a deep narrative element. | /setvar key=분석내용 {{pipe}} ||\n\n/gen <System>Pause the RP. You are an expert web designer specializing in creating visually stunning, self-contained HTML and CSS code snippets.\n\nYour task is to transform the following content into a single, embeddable HTML block.\n\n{{getvar::분석내용}}\n\n\n## Output Structure:\n- It must start with a `<style>` tag containing all CSS.\n- Immediately following the closing `</style>` tag, provide the HTML content.\n- **Crucially, do NOT include `<html>`, `<head>`, or `<body>` tags.** The code must be a fragment ready to be embedded inside an existing page.\n\n## Design & Technical Requirements:\n1.  **Thematic Analysis:** Analyze the content's tone (e.g., professional, playful, fantasy, sci-fi) and choose a matching aesthetic for colors, fonts, and layout.\n2.  **Responsive Design:** Use modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid, custom properties) to ensure the layout is responsive and looks great on all screen sizes.\n3.  **Expressive Typography:** Select and pair fonts that enhance the theme. Create a clear visual hierarchy with different font sizes, weights, and styles.\n4.  **Dynamic Effects & Interactivity:**\n    *   Incorporate subtle but engaging CSS transitions, animations, or transforms.\n    *   Design interactive elements like cards with hover effects, animated decorative elements, or styled buttons.\n    *   Use gradients, box-shadows, and blend modes for depth and visual flair.\n5.  **Custom Visuals & Icons:**\n    *   Integrate thematic SVG icons or custom CSS-drawn shapes (e.g., decorative borders, abstract patterns, flourishes) that align with the content's theme.\n    *   Prioritize CSS for visual accents over raster images to keep the snippet lightweight.\n6.  **Accessibility & Readability:** Ensure high contrast for text and logical content structure (using semantic tags like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, etc., where appropriate).\n7.  **Multi-Layered Depth:** Flat design is unacceptable. You must construct a sense of depth and tactility. Layer elements using z-index, positioning, and opacity. Combine text, shapes, icons, and imagery into a cohesive whole.\n\n8.  **Integrated Imagery Mandate:** One or more images from `pollinations.ai` (Format: `https://pollinations.ai/p/{prompt}`) MUST be integrated into the design. Use them as portraits, icons, textures, diagrams, holographic projections, backgrounds, or fragments within the larger composition.\n9.  **Inherent Life:** The panel must feel alive on load. It MUST feature subtle, continuous ambient animations (e.g., soft pulses, drifting particles, glowing text, shimmering energy) to create a sense of presence before any user interaction.\n10.  **Full-Spectrum Toolkit:** You are mandated to employ the full spectrum of CSS and JavaScript to create a rich visual experience. Utilize filters, blend modes, transforms, complex transitions, dynamic typography, SVG manipulation, animations, and pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) to build a unique and tactile interface.\n11. **=== CRITICAL SYNTAX RULE ===**\nThe `{{...}}` placeholder syntax (like `{{user}}` or `{{char}}`) is **INVALID** inside a `<style>` block and will break the code. You **MUST NOT** use any `{{...}}` placeholders between the `<style>` and `</style>` tags. Use them only in the HTML part of the code that comes *after* the closing `</style>` tag.\n\n12. **=== CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMATTING ===**\nThe following rule is the most important. Failure to comply will render the entire output useless.\n-   **DO NOT USE MARKDOWN FENCES.** Your response must NOT contain ``` at all!!!.\n-   Your entire response must be **RAW HTML CODE** and nothing else.\n-   Start your answer *directly* with the `<style>` tag. No introductory text, no explanations.\n\nBegin generating the raw HTML snippet immediately after this instruction.</System>|\n/comment <details>\n  <summary>Analysis of: {{getvar::질문내용}}</summary>\n  <div>{{pipe}}</div>\n</details>||","contextList":[],"preventAutoExecute":true,"isHidden":false,"executeOnStartup":false,"executeOnUser":false,"executeOnAi":false,"executeOnChatChange":false,"executeOnGroupMemberDraft":false,"executeOnNewChat":false,"automationId":""},{"id":36,"icon":"fa-face-smile-beam","showLabel":true,"label":"Meme","title":"Generates a humorous meme or visual gag related to the roleplay.
